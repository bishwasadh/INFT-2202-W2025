Pokemon App

(User Stories) As A User...

Note: I like to follow the structure of building the route -> controller -> view

1. AAU, I want to be able to search a pokemon and see the pokemon that I searched (DONE)
   1. Change test/hello page to a home page, and add search form on index.ejs (DONE)
   2. Define the route: POST /searchPokemon 
   3. Define the controller: function searchPokemon(req, res) {}
   4. Define the view: pokemonResults.ejs

2. AAU, I want to be able to save a pokemon to my party (DONE)
   1. Create a button in pokemonResults.ejs to save a pokemon in party, and the button will submit a form when clicked that contains the pokemon data as hidden fields. The form will create a POST HTTP request to /savePokemon
   2. Create a route in our router to handle a POST request for /savePokemon
   3. Create a controller called savePokemonToParty(req,res){} that will handle the request at /savePokemon
   4. In the controller, we will take the form data from the request body and push the data into our pokemonParty array
   5. At the end of the controller logic, we will render a page called myPokemonParty.ejs which will display all the pokemons in my party
3. AAU, I want to be able to see a list of all the pokemons in my party (DONE)
4. AAU, I want to be able to delete/remove a pokemon from my party
5. Read on EJS partials, and create a header and a footer for all our EJS pages
   - Include in the header a NAVBAR that will help the user navigate to all our GET routes (i.e./, /showParty)
   - Include a footer that is appropriate
6. Add CSS bootstrap integration to EJS to make it look nicer
---------------------------------------------
7. (Challenge) Add functionality to edit/update an existing pokemon
   1. On myPokemonParty.ejs, we will add a new button for each pokemon that says 'EDIT Pokemon'. This button will be part of a link that will pass the mongodb _id of the pokemon in the URL as a query parameter in the HTTP request to the backend
   2. We will then create a GET /editPokemon/:id route
   3. We will then create a displayEditPokemonPage(req, res) controller
   4. This controller will then extract the _id of the pokemon from the req.query params and use that to fetch the pokemon info from mongodb. We will then render a page called editPokemon.ejs
   5. The editPokemon.ejs page will have a form on it with the existing pokemon data. We will allow the user to modify the data in this form, and have an update button at the bottom
   6. Create a POST /updatePokemon route
   7. Create a updatePokemon(req, res) method in the controllers
   ---------------------------------------------
8. Implement Authenticiation for our App with Passport.js
   1. Signup.ejs page
   2. Login.ejs page
   3. Create route -> POST /login 
   4. Create route -> POSR /signup
   5. Create passport-jwt.ts middleware
   6. Mount middleware in index.ts (OR in all our routers)
   7. Store req.user in global variable
   8. Add conditional logic in navbar
   9. Create route GET /logout
